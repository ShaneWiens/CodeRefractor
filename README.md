Unit 1 Homework

For this assignment I reviewed an HTML file and simplified the code along with the style.CSS file to make the code easier to read and bundle element using the same attributes together.

Each portion of content contained class selectors unique to the elements to which they are attached. Several unique classes within a section shared identical css stylings. For each section class selectors were simplified into a single class that captured all elements within the main section that had the same style. 

The first of each 'duplicate' class within the css files was renamed to the new generalized class for each section. The two subsequent duplicate stylings were deleted.
